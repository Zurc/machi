			<h1>I'm Mar√≠a</h1>
			<p>I have a very atypical path both personally and professionally. I was born in Cameroun and raised in 6 different countries and 3 continents. I speak English, French and Spanish fluently.
			<br>I have been good at math and science since my childhood, studying and obtaining a diploma in Electronics Engineering. After working in that field for a couple of years, I decided to learn design on my own and have been working as a designer and developer since July 2007.</p>
